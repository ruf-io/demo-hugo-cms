      The simplicity of SQL queries, but with millisecond-level latency for real-time data. That is Materialize, the only true SQL streaming database for building internal tools, interactive dashboards, and customer-facing experiences.

      We are not “disrupting” or changing the behaviors of the world’s population, but instead building something that works in a space where most products simply do not. Our work builds on top of [Timely Dataflow](https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/timely-dataflow) and [Differential Dataflow](https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow), both created by our co-founder [Frank McSherry](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog).
